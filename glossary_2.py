'''Clean up your code from glossary.py by replacing your series of print
statements with a loop that runs through the dictionary's keys and values.
When youÂ´re sure your loop works, add five more Python terms to your
glossary. When you run your program again, these new words and meanings
should automatically be included in your output.'''
